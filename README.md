# Getting Started

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
2. Run `yarn dev` to begin developing.

# Adding Contracts

To add a contract and have [Typechain](https://github.com/ethereum-ts/TypeChain) generate types for it, simply drop the contract's ABI (as a JSON file) into the `contracts` directory. Types are then generated by running `yarn typechain` and output to the `contracts/types` directory.
