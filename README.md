# Getting Frontend Started

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
2. Run `yarn dev` to begin developing.

To add a contract and have [Typechain](https://github.com/ethereum-ts/TypeChain) generate types for it, simply drop the contract's ABI (as a JSON file) into the `contracts` directory. Types are then generated by running `yarn typechain` and output to the `contracts/types` directory.

# Getting Contracts Started
1. `dapp build` the contracts to compile their code
2. `dapp test` to run their tests
3. Run `dapp testnet` to create local geth instance
4. Create a new metamask network with the provided `RPC URL`, and `Chain ID`
5. `dapp create` to deploy the contracts to testnet
